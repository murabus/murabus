"I think going over what we learned in lecture was super helpful because somethings were very unclear and our TA made sure people participated so when I did, it helped me process the information better."

"This discussions section helped to apply the concepts to the real world."

"The discussion section is very helpful in clearly understanding the topics of the course and applying them in a more familiar context."

"I believe that the discussion section of this class was by far my favorite this semester. The way it provided practical, current examples to the theory in lecture really helped me when it came time for papers and exams."

"The discussion section helped me to better understand the course content. I was able to make connections between certain topics and understand where they fit in better."

"I thought the discussion section was very well done. Mr. Abus was very helpful and made every lesson very fun and engaging."

"Murat is able to help me with my essays and help improve."

"I found the discussion portions the most valuable."

"The interaction with the TA and his willingness to work with me on my papers and prepare the class for the exam."

"I found group discussions to be most valuable. I did like that the discussion leader noted who was participating, and ensured that was reflective in the grade."

"I enjoyed discussing the content and being able to participate and ask questions. Murat was very helpful at answering questions and encouraging people to participate to learn the material."

"He was very very helpful in making sure that all students understood the material. He would even reiterate it in different ways and would add humorous examples which was great for me in getting a better understanding."

"An amazing TA. Explained things very clearly and made hard concepts easier for the class."

"Teaching methods definitely contributed to my learning. I liked how we followed along in class with his coding and then he uploaded the code for us to look at later on. Was always helpful with answering questions during class and made sure we really understood everything."

"Abus fostered an environment where students were comfortable enough to ask questions and add to the discussion. This helped a lot in my learning having a lot of dialogue rather than him lecturing the whole time. He asked a lot of questions so that forced me to get on guard and make sure I was familiar with the concepts."

"Mr. Abus is perhaps the most highly effective instructor I’ve ever met. He teaches in a way that is engaging, fun, and novel. For instance, he teaches regression using a unique “cloud” method he devised himself; I’ve never seen it anywhere else, and I am convinced it is the best way to truly understand the concept. After listening to him, I felt able not only to intuit concepts and use them myself, but also to teach them to a peer. It is obvious he loves what he does, and puts his best effort into every lecture/recitation. Having him as a TA has been one of the most helpful things A&M has provided me."

"Always encouraged us to first try on our own, but he made it very clear each class that he wanted us to come to him with questions. Murat is the best TA I have ever had. He responds to emails in a very timely manner- usually within 20 minutes. He is also available later in the evening which is super helpful. A very fair TA. Told us at the beginning of the semester that as long as we were showing up to class and clearly making an effort, we would do well in the class. I would strongly encourage anyone to take his TA section. I would also have loved having him as a professor instead of a TA."

"He always mentioned that he was available for help a lot of the times. I learned the hard way that I had to get it together and not be afraid to ask for help."
