</br ></br > Welcome! I am a first-gen PhD Candidate in Political Science at [Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/academics/political-science-department), [Syracuse University](https://www.syracuse.edu). Since August 2024, I am working as the inaugural graduate research assistant at Syracuse University's recently established [Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenhip](https://idjc.syracuse.edu) in Washington, D.C. 

I am a student of American Politics, Comparative Politics and Methodology. I study political behavior, political communication, public opinion, elections, and methodology. I enjoy teaching and collaborating. I believe in exposure through collaboration, and I am a proponent and practitioner of establishing strong connections with students. I try to be active in the conference circuit. In addition to Turkish, I speak Russian.

Outside of the work that I love, cars, travelling, and archaeology are three primary things that continue to fascinate me. Specifically, I am interested in late-model classic cars, the transition from paleolithic to neolithic eras, and civilizations of the Old World. I grew up in [Erzurum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erzurum) in Eastern Turkey with an altitude of 1,900mt (6,233ft) above sea level.
