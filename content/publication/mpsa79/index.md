abstract: Conceptualizing the effect of religion on political participation requires a more nuanced approach than simply assuming the effect of this variable changes slowly over long periods of time. I set out to test the contention that the effect of religiosity on political participation can change over relatively shorter periods of time. Testing this idea using survey data from a turbulent period of Turkey from 2013 to 2014, I find suggestive evidence that this type of political participation can also change even within a year.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, I set out to test whether the effect of religiosity on political participation changes in shorter periods as opposed to the view that these changes are usually glacial.
