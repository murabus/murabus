The map files are freely available on the internet, and the one we will use can be obtained from Shapefiles. We will need the turkey_administrativelevels0_1_2.zip file. This zip file contains the administrative boundaries for the country, provinces, and districts. In this tutorial, we are creating a map at the district level and this is the second level. After unzipping the file, extract the following files to a folder of your choice:3\n tur_polbnda_adm2.cpg tur_polbnda_adm2.dbf tur_polbnda_adm2.prj tur_polbnda_adm2.sbn tur_polbnda_adm2.sbx tur_polbnda_adm2.shp tur_polbnda_adm2.shp.xml tur_polbnda_adm2.shx  Now that we have our shapefile in folder, we will need to generate / get our substantive data for the variable that we want to map.4For this tutorial, grab the substantive dataset and place it in the same folder as with the shapefiles.5\nBefore we get down to it, two words of advice: First, it is important to realize these types of detailed maps do not show causation per se (Healy 2018, 182).6 Second, I intentionally did not provide a .do file so that the reader will type the commands themselves, and generate their own .do files with the comments that they think will be useful in the future. This - I have been led to believe - is a best practice in learning.\nLet us start typing those commands!\n1. Preliminaries First order of business, as usual, is to check where in the file system we are. Using the following command, check the current working directory and point Stata to the folder of our files by Shift+Control+F.\npwd Now that we are where we want to be in the file system, we will use Stata‚Äôs built-in spatial commands. First, issue the following command to have Stata use all the shapefiles in our folder to generate a .dta dataset that we can manipulate using Stata.\nspshape2dta tur_polbnda_adm2, replace We will see the following output on the console, confirming that Stata used all the shapefiles to create a .dta file that we can manipulate.\n   Let us load this dataset and have a look at it.\nuse \u0026#34;tur_polbnda_adm2.dta\u0026#34;, clear describe    Looking at the generated dataset, there are two important variables. These are the ‚Äú_ID‚Äù and ‚Äúpcode‚Äù variables. The main logic here is to be able to have a unique identifier for each geographic unit. A note from this dataset is that even though ‚Äú_ID‚Äù variable starts from 1 and increases the corresponding ‚Äúpcode‚Äù variable does not start with the first district (alphabetical or the first province). This is an important concern, so we will do some data cleaning to make sure that the first district has an ‚Äúid‚Äù of ‚Äú1‚Äù and corresponds to ‚ÄúTUR001001‚Äù.\n   ‚Äúpcode‚Äù variable is string, so we can not do any manipulation, so with the following code we first encode it and then based on the code we sort the dataset. In order to have a second variable to use in uniquely identifying each unit, we also generate a new ‚Äúid‚Äù variable startimg from 1. We want to have an ordered dataset with two unique identifiers for each geographical unit.\nencode pcode, generate(dcode) drop pcode rename dcode pcode sort pcode gen id = _n Let us check our work.\ndescribe    We have our id variable and pcode variable is not string anymore. All looks good, so we can save our map dataset:\nsave \u0026#34;tur_polbnda_adm2.dta\u0026#34;, replace Just like we define a time-series dataset to Stata using the ‚Äútsset‚Äù command, while our dataset is in memory, we define it as a spatial dataset with the following command:\nspset    In order to check if this definition is successful, we use Stata‚Äôs built-in grmap command to see if Stata can draw the borders in this dataset. This is the spatial dataset and will include only the borders.\ngrmap    This confirms that our map data is properly defined as we see the borders of districts drawn. Next order of business is the coordinate system. In the console output above we see that the coordinate system is planar, so we are modifying it with the following command:\nspset, modify coordsys(latlong, kilometers) Our preliminary work is done. We prepared our map dataset to be used in the analysis. Now we need to merge the datasets in such a way that the new dataset will now not only have borders (spatial information) but also values of our variable of interest (here mosque density) corresponding to each of those units. So, it will be possible to create a choropleth map. We save our dataset before proceeding.\nsave \u0026#34;tur_polbnda_adm2.dta\u0026#34;, replace 2. Merging Datasets Let us load our substantive dataset of this tutorial and have a look at it.\nuse \u0026#34;abus_mosque_density.dta\u0026#34;, clear describe A look at the first few ‚Ä¶","date":1656460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656460800,"objectID":"21ea621fd78aad79573ae6002b06329f","permalink":"https://muratabus.com/post/practical-introduction-to-mapping-with-stata/","publishdate":"2022-06-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/practical-introduction-to-mapping-with-stata/","section":"post","summary":"This is a relatively short, practical introduction to mapping with Stata designed to get the newcomer started in no time and provide a quick refresher as needed.","tags":["Stata","Mapping","Choropleth map"],"title":"Practical Introduction to Mapping with Stata","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Student Testimonials\n  ‚ÄúHe was very very helpful in making sure that all students understood the material.

Explained things very clearly and made hard concepts easier for the class.‚Äù\n‚ÄúTeaching methods definitely contributed to my learning. I liked how we followed along in class with his coding and then he uploaded the code for us to look at later on. Was always helpful with answering questions during class and made sure we really understood everything.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAbus fostered an environment where students were comfortable enough to ask questions and add to the discussion. This helped a lot in my learning having a lot of dialogue rather than him lecturing the whole time. He asked a lot of questions so that forced me to get on guard and make sure I was familiar with the concepts.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMr. Abus is perhaps the most highly effective instructor I‚Äôve ever met. He teaches in a way that is engaging, fun, and novel. For instance, he teaches regression using a unique ‚Äúcloud‚Äù method he devised himself; I‚Äôve never seen it anywhere else, and I am convinced it is the best way to truly understand the concept. After listening to him, I felt able not only to intuit concepts and use them myself, but also to teach them to a peer. It is obvious he loves what he does, and puts his best effort into every lecture/recitation. Having him as a TA has been one of the most helpful things A\u0026amp;M has provided me.‚Äù\n‚ÄúAlways encouraged us to first try on our own, but he made it very clear each class that he wanted us to come to him with questions. Murat is the best TA I have ever had. He responds to emails in a very timely manner- usually within 20 minutes. He is also available later in the evening which is super helpful. A very fair TA. Told us at the beginning of the semester that as long as we were showing up to class and clearly making an effort, we would do well in the class. I would strongly encourage anyone to take his TA section. I would also have loved having him as a professor instead of a TA.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHe always mentioned that he was available for help a lot of the times.
